# .vimrc config
This is my vim setup to use the same config on muiltiple systems. 
This also includes configuration for using vrapper plugin for Eclipse and ideavim on InteliJ. 

basic.vim includes shared configurations and .files include specific configurations.


##Instalation
Running install.bat or install.sh creates symlinks on the home directory for the cofinguration files. On windows, this requires an elevated promp.
